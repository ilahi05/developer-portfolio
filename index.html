            <h2>He is vengeance. He is the night. He is Batman.</h2>
            <p>One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless
                crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was
                just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to
                be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame.
                And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and
                Batman, Incorporated.</p>
